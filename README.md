# PRODIGY_SD_02
internship task-2 at the Prodigy InfoTech.

- **Create a Guessing Game**
- Build a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program should prompt the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. It should continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then display the number of attempts it took to win the game.

**Overview :**
This project is an interactive Guessing Game developed in Python. The game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, enhancing user engagement and ease of use.

**Features:**
- User-Friendly Interface:
    - Developed using Tkinter to provide an intuitive and visually appealing GUI.
    - Users can easily input their guesses and receive real-time feedback.
    
- Engaging Gameplay:
    - Generates a random number within a specified range for the user to guess.
    - Tracks the number of attempts and provides feedback to guide the user toward the correct answer.
      
- Input Validation and Error Handling:
    - Validates user inputs to ensure they are within the acceptable range.
    - Provides informative feedback for invalid inputs, ensuring smooth gameplay.

 **Technologies Used**

- Python:
    - Core programming language used for game logic and functionality.
    
- Tkinter:
    - Python's standard GUI toolkit used to create the user interface.
    
- Random Library:
    - Utilized for generating random numbers for the guessing game.
  

**How to Use**
1. Clone the Repository:
```html
git clone https://github.com/your-username/guessing-game.git
cd guessing-game
```
2. Run the Game:
```html
python guessing_game.py
```
3. Play the Game:
  - Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Guess" button.
  - The game will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
  - Continue guessing until you find the correct number. The game will display the number of attempts taken.

**Example Usage**

When the user starts the game, they will be prompted to guess a number. For example, if the number to guess is 42:

- User Guess: 30
  - Feedback: "Too low, try again."
  
- User Guess: 50
  - Feedback: "Too high, try again."
- User Guess: 42
  - Feedback: "Congratulations! You've guessed the correct number in X attempts."

**Future Enhancements**
- Add difficulty levels with different ranges of numbers.
- Implement a scoring system based on the number of attempts.
- Enhance the GUI with more interactive elements and improved aesthetics.
